In December of 2013, the  British Medical Journal  published a paper detailing the alcohol consumption habits James Bond in Ian Fleming’s novels (Johnson, Guha, & Davies, 2013). Noting that alcohol consumption is often glamorized in entertainment (and that Bond’s habits are particularly noteworthy as is his preference for vodka martinis, “shaken, not stirred”), the authors read Fleming’s fourteen Bond books and took notes on his drinking habits. Unsurprisingly, they found that Bond drinks a lot.

During the 123.5 days that pass over the books in total, Bond consumed 1150.15 units of alcohol1 (about 383 beers or vodka martinis). If we exclude the 36 days during which Bond wasn’t able to drink (due to external circumstances, such as hospitalization or imprisonment), this averages to about 30 beers or martinis a week (abou 4 1⁄4 a day). Bond’s wildest bender occurred on the third day of  From Russia with Love  during which he drank the equivalent of about 16 and half beers’ worth of alcohol.

This record of James Bond’s drinking habits is interesting from a number of perspectives. As the paper was published in the  BMJ , the authors were primarily interested in the health consequences of habits such as those of Bond. For instance, they note that his weekly alcohol intake is four times greater than that which is advisable for an adult male, placing him at a considerable risk for a number of conditions including cirrhosis of the liver and impotence.

But the record also raises some interesting cultural issues regarding representations of substance use in fiction. For instance, should we expect works of fiction to depict attitudes towards substances that mirror those of the time and culture in which they are published? Should we expect the frequency with which a substance is used in fiction to resemble real-life usage patterns?

Inspired by the Bond article, I set out to begin exploring these questions, though I decided to focus on representations of smoking rather than drinking. My hope was to get some sense of how the frequency of smoking and attitudes towards the behavior in fiction have changed over time. In addition I had a methodological aim, namely, to explore the possibility of investigating these sorts of issues using computational methods, rather than reading books and taking diligent notes.
