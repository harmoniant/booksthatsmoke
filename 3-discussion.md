A couple of things stand out about the findings related to frequency of cigarette references in novels over time.

First, the general trend corresponds to decreases in smoking rates in the general population. According to a 2014 review paper, in the 20th century per capita cigarette consumption in the United States increased steadily until 1953 when 47% of adults were smokers (58% of males and 36% of females). By 2011, less than 20% of adults smoked. Furthermore, the authors report that by 1957, smoking had been established as a causative factor in lung cancer which led to the first official statement from the US Public Health Service (Cummings and Proctor, 2014). This roughly lines up with the latest major peak in cigarette counts.

Second, the general trend also matches up with the results of a historical analysis of the portrayal of tobacco in American movies since 1950. This analysis found that total tobacco-related content in films peaked in 1961 (shortly after “peak cigarette” in novels, though the use of tobacco by main characters had been declining since 1950 (Jamieson and Romer, 2010).

While these results are based on a fairly small set of texts, they at least suggest that there may be similarities in how culture is portrayed in film and in novels, and that these portrayals mirror reality to some degree. Moreover, they cast a promising light on the use of computational methods to investigate representations of behaviors in texts, methods that could allow us to study representations of behaviors across entire corpuses of literature (not just those of a famous British spy).
